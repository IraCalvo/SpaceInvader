# SpaceInvader
Class Game

This class game is like space invaders, where the player controls a spaceship and has to shoot the incoming attackers before they collide with the player.
this game features:
-Left/Right movement
-AI behaviors to increase the speed of the enemy based on how close they are to the player
-Shooting from both the player and enemies
-Timer so that the player and enemies do not non-stop shoot at each other

This game in particular taught me about Prefabs and Instantiation. Instantiation a method in which creates a give game objects on the screen so that it can be used by
the game.
